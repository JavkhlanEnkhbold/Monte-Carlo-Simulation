# Monte-Carlo-Simulation


The core idea of Monte Carlo isto learn about a system by simulating it with random sampling.  That approachis  powerful,  flexible  and  very  direct.   It  is  often  the  simplest  way  to  solve  aproblem, and sometimes the only feasible way.The  Monte  Carlo  method  is  used  in  almost  every  quantitative  subject  ofstudy:  physical sciences, engineering, statistics, finance, and computing, includ-ing machine learning and graphics.  
Monte Carlo is even applied in some areas,like music theory, that are not always thought of as quantitative.
